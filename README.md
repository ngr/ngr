### Nikolay Grishchenko

As you have probably guessed, my name is Nik. <br>
I have being programming in different languages since 1997. I love Python. I love AWS.

Combining both Python and AWS, I enjoy creating serverless and event-driven applications. <br>
Somewhere between 500 and 1,000 of those in my portfolio running for different companies. Yes, I release a couple of new Lambdas here and there almost every week.

Together with my colleagues and OpenSouce enthusiasts we have created [sosw](https://docs.sosw.app/) OpenSource framework and orchestration tool for AWS Lambda.

But most of all I love to teach. That is why I have [SOSW - training programs for developers](https://www.sosw.app/). <br>
We also provide consulting services and designing architectures for complex web, event processing and data processing applications.

And this is my attitude towards datascience:

```
import tensorflow as plt
import pandas as tf
import numpy as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as np
```
